KarmaCharmeleon is a relatively new creator in the Mugen scene but has managed to be very prolific.
Karma's creation are in the "PotS style", which I'm somewhat partial to - more on that later.
In SF4, Gouken was my main. I liked his playstyle, even if he was a low tier character.
Of all of Karma's creations to date, this is my favorite.
The combination of systems, the exquisite sprite work of benhazard and C.V.S.N.B., a great buffering system, and Karma's attention to detail really come together in this one.

### Gameplay Systems Overview
Most of KarmaChameleon's characters, to include Gouken, are in the "PotS style" which (in the Mugen community) is a popular collection of gameplay systems loosely pulled from CvS2.
I'll admit that I am not the biggest fan of "PotS style" - I typically favor more succinct and coherent gameplay systems, but PotS style isn't about balance, it's about allowing the user access to whatever systems they enjoy.
That said, there is no denying that PotS, JMorphman and many others like Karma have honed this style to a point where it is compelling and fun.

| `EX Specials`      | Gouken can spend half a power bar to execute an EX version of the special. Gouken have several notable EX Specials that unnlock significant damage potential.                                                                                                                                |
| `Special Cancels`  | All of Gouken's Special moves can be cancelled into super moves if meter is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `MAX Cancels`      | Some Level 1 Supers can be cancelled into MAX Supers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Custom Combos`    | Activating Custom allows all moves to be cancelled, removes limitations on the juggle system, and gives a short invulnerability window at the start. Additionally, when Gouken flashes towards the end of the Custom, Gouken can use an EX Special or Level 1 Super to end the Custom Combo. |

Gouken is a six-button character and has similar gameplay to his SSF4 incarnation, but supercharged by the gameplay systems afforded to him through PotS style.
The Forward and Backward Rolls are not particularly useful in light of his other new mobility options.
Short Hop and Super Short Hop are extremely strong and allow Gouken to make use of his strong air attacks like :icon{name="_AIR"}:icon{name="^HK"}.
The Parry options are strong, but are in tension with his counter move specials.
The Zero Counter (:icon{name="_QBD"}:icon{name="_++"}:icon{name="^P"} or :icon{name="^K"}) options are quite good and can get an enemy off your back with reasonable confidence you won't be hit out of the counter attack.
