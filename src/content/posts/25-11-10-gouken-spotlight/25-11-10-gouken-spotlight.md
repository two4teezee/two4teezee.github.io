KarmaCharmeleon is a relatively new creator in the Mugen scene but has managed to be very prolific.
Karma's creation are in the "PotS style", which I'm somewhat partial to - more on that later.
In SF4, Gouken was my main. I liked his playstyle, even if he was a low tier character.
Of all of Karma's creations to date, this is my favorite.
The combination of systems, the exquisite sprite work of benhazard and C.V.S.N.B., a great buffering system, and Karma's attention to detail really come together in this one.

### Gameplay Systems Overview
Most of KarmaChameleon's characters, to include Gouken, are in the "PotS style" which in the Mugen community is a popular collection of gameplay systems loosely pulled from CvS2.
I'll admit that I am not the biggest fan of "PotS style" - I typically favor more succinct and coherent gameplay systems.
That said, there is no denying that PotS, JMorphman and many others like Karma have honed this style to a point where it is compelling and fun.

Gouken is a six-button character with the usual accoutrement of PotS style gameplay systems:
