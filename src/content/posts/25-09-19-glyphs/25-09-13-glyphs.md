These Ikemen GO glyphs created for the brokenIKEMEN screenpack and this website.

This glyphs pack for Ikemen GO contains iconography for all buttons and command shorthands currently supported by Ikemen GO's glyphs feature, along with some extras not currently supported by the engine.

This repo contains `.sff` files for two versions of the glyphs, with and without shadows.
Additionally, in the `src` folder, you'll find a tilemap of the glyphs without shadows, and tiles with and without shadows for all glyphs (to include unsupported glyph types in Ikemen GO at time of release).
The tiles without shadows are `20px`, while the tiles with shadows are `26px`.

This release uses Kenney's ["Input Prompts Pixel 16x"](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/input-prompts-pixel-16) as a starting point for the buttons, some of the motions, and color palette cues.
Big shout out to them for this work.
