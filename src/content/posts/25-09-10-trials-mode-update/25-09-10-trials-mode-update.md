A new update for the Ikemen GO Trials Mode, now revved to [v0.99.3](https://github.com/two4teezee/Ikemen-GO-Trials-Mode/releases/tag/0.99.3). 
This update introduces a simple hotfix to prevent crashing if the user is partway through a trial, pauses, and switches trials using the pause menu options.
Updating is recommended and will not be breaking to your implementation.
Enjoy!
