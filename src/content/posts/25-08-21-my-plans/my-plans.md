Well, I've been flirting with this idea for years, but for a variety of reasons I think now is the time: two4teezeee needs a website.
Let me explain.

I don't really remember what led me to the Mugen scene in the mid 2000s but I can tell you that contributing to the scene was formative in many ways.
It reinforced my penchant for technical endeavors but it also gave me a creative outlet through which I could express myself.
As with most things in life, "real life" got in the way of continued contributions to the Mugen scene. 
Shortly after I released brokenMUGEN, I was wrapping up college and moving on to my first real job.

I found my way back to Mugen in 2014 when Saikoro emailed me directly to update the screenpack. 
This return to the scene was short-lived, I was simply too busy.

Like many other creators, I came back to the scene when Covid struck.
But Covid was a reminder to many of us that had left the scene and came back - hobbies are good, and Mugen is cool.
Mugen is a bit in disarray, but Ikemen GO is thriving and seeing so much new development, it is truly exciting.

Well, here we are now, with some time spent on Ikemen GO, more or less as time goes by, and my personal life hasn't gotten any less busy.
Over the years since Covid I've continuously come back to Ikemen GO and the community is healthy in all of the right ways.
Then, I watched GuileWinQuote's video titled [`Reminiscing About Mugen`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIP4pNMp1lE&pp=ygULZ3VpbGUgbXVnZW4%3D).
This 23ish minute video made me realize that so many of us had our own journey with Mugen... and that really resonated with me.

So: I decided that moving forward, I want to share *my* Ikemen GO journey with all of you.
On my website, I will:
- Spotlight creations from other creators that I admire
    - Showcasing the vibrant modules and add-on ecosystem in Ikemen GO
    - Highlighting creators, characters, stages, and screenpacks I enjoy, both old and new, presented in a way that draws inspiration from old school "guide book" publications
- Communicate updates to my creations (many of which have been private in the past)
- Rant about random crap

I'll try to release updates to the website roughly every other week.
These updates will come as articles, updates to my own creations, or maybe updates to the website itself.
I hope you enjoy my ramblings - if you do, please reach out to me on Discord.
