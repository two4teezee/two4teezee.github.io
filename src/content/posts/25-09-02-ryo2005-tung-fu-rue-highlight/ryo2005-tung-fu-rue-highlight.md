Ryo2005 is one of the great Mugen creators from Japan.
He has continuously been releasing characters and stages since 2009 and is still active in 2025.
Over the years, Ryo2005 has cemented his own gameplay style, in the same way PotS developed his.
In this article, we'll use Ryo2005's take on Tung Fu Rue.
We'll use this character to deep dive the gameplay systems he has developed over his prolific content creation career.

Ryo2005's characters have a certain simplicity to them that grounds them, and to me as a fighting game purist, it really appeals to me.
Ryo2005 has managed to develop a huge cast of characters that could fit neatly into a late 90s/early 2000s SNK title, and frankly there are so many of them now that you could easily create a full game around them... I wonder why he hasn't.
Anyway, let's dive in to Ryo2005's take on one of my favorite characters in the SNK universe, Tung Fu Rue!

### Gameplay Systems Overview
Ryo2005's characters have pretty standard movement options, with a regular jump, short jump, run, and backdash.
This renders his characters easily overwhelmed by MvC or anime characters with more exotic movement options available to them.
Additionally, because his characters tend to be pretty footsy-heavy, they are heavily punished by characters that have push-block mechanics, so keep that in mind when assembling your roster.

Ryo2005's characters are "four" button characters.
While they abide by standard SNK two punches and two kicks, a fifth button is used for a "Heavy Attack" with limited usefulness (typically only ground-based with no variations) and the sixth button is used for Dodge Roll.
The Dodge Roll mechanic is especially important to even the playing field against characters that have more movement options available to them.
Against charaters with high movement and attack speed, you'll find yourself leveraging the Dodge Roll to great effect.

Earlier I mentioned that Ryo2005's characters tend to be pretty footsy-heavy.
To drive that home, Ryo2005 gives his characters the ability to chain command normals from normal moves.
This often opens significant opportunities for trapping opponents down and pressing the advantage through a variety of block strings and follow-up attacks.
For instance, Tung has a Command Normal that allows him to stay on the opponent by closing range and being relatively safe on block.

The Heavy Attack and Dodge Roll buttons are used for Guard Cancel mechanics as well. 
Using the Heavy Attack button while guarding will cost one power bar and basically triggers an Alpha Counter type attack.
Meanwhile, using the Dodge Roll button while guarding also costs on power bar but allows the user to evade/break the block string to get in a potentially advantageous position (for instance, swapping out corner position).

Finally, all of Ryo2005's characters have "Rage Combo", which is triggered by hitting both Strong Punch and Strong Kick at the same time.
Connecting with the Rage Combo attack will allow the user to input a five button combination leading to a six hit combo.
Typically, each character has a ground and air variant of the Rage Combination - access the air version by holding up or up-forward as soon as the Rage Combination opener hits.
The Rage Combination mechanic is very strong: it typically ends with a final attack that gives the user enough time to set up a juggle afterwards.
Not only that, but the Rage Combination can be triggered to cancel a normal or Command Normal move to significantly extend combos - doing so will cost one power bar.

That covers the gameplay systems of Ryo2005's characters.
He has done a remarkable job of creating a huge roster of characters with a homogeneous playset, with a combination of gameplay systems that allows for fun, well paced gameplay and the occasional devastating combo.
With that out of the way, let's talk about Tung Fu Rue.

### An Intro to Tung Fu Rue
Tung Fu Rue is not the most popular character in the SNK universe, but he's been around for quite a while.
He made his first appearance in the first Fatal Fury game, and periodically been brought back - the sprites Ryo2005 used are from Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.
In Fatal Fury 1, he was introduced as the legendary master of the style known as Hakkyokuseiken and as the man responsible for training several of the series' main characters, like Andy Bogard.
Throughout his appearances, Tung is always depicted as an elderly man in his late 60s to early 80s and I've always found that entertaining.
His small stature makes it so that you have to get in-close - Ryo2005 did a nice job of giving him a kit that enables him to do that.
Tung doesn't have a projectile but he typically has pretty quick movement, and once you're in you can inflict quite a bit of damage in fast flurries.
Let's take a look at the movelist that Ryo2005 gave him.

### Normal and Command Normals Highlights

|--|--:|
| While Crouching Weak Kick is not listed in as a chainable normal, it chains into itself twice, and that can then be chained into a Command Normal. This is in contrast to the close range Weak Kick, Weak Kick, Strong Pucnh chain advertised in Ryo2005's official moveset - Tung doesn't have to be very close for this to work and he can leverage the gap-closing Halo Break Command Normal to turn a quick poke into an offensive blockstring. | <img src="/src/content/posts/25-09-02-ryo2005-tung-fu-rue-highlight/tung-thumb.webp" width="200" style="margin:0;display:block" />

| This attack has a surprising amount of range to it by propelling Tung forward into a spinning kick. With good timing, this can be use to punish whiffs and lead into big combos. It takes a bit to come out, but when you get good at using this weaved between other attacks, you can use it to great success. | <img src="/src/content/posts/25-08-23-trials-mode/trials.png" style="margin:0;display:block" /> | <img src="/src/content/posts/25-08-23-trials-mode/trials.png" style="margin:0;display:block" /> |

| This is Tung's best normal, and it's not even close. The hitbox on this is huge and it actually has great priority - it can even cross up under the right conditions. | <img src="/src/content/posts/25-09-02-ryo2005-tung-fu-rue-highlight/tung-thumb.webp" width="200" style="margin:0;display:block" /> |
