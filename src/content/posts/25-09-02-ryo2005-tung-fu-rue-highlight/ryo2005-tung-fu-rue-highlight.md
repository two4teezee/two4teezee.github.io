Ryo2005 is one of the great Mugen creators from Japan.
He has continuously been releasing characters and stages since 2009 and is still active in 2025.
Over the years, Ryo2005 has cemented his own gameplay style, in the same way PotS developed his.
In this article, we'll use Ryo2005's take on Tung Fu Rue.
We'll use this character to deep dive the gameplay systems he has developed over his prolific content creation career.
Ryo2005's characters have a certain simplicity to them that grounds them, and to me as a fighting game purist, it really appeals to me.
Ryo2005 has managed to develop a huge cast of characters that could fit neatly into a late 90s/early 2000s SNK title, and frankly there are so many of them now that you could easily create a full game around them... I wonder why he hasn't.
Anyway, let's dive in to Ryo2005's take on one of my favorite characters in the SNK universe, Tung Fu Rue!

### An Intro to Tung Fu Rue
Tung Fu Rue is not the most popular character in the SNK universe, but he's been around for quite a while.
He made his first appearance in the first Fatal Fury game, and periodically been brought back - the sprites Ryo2005 used are from Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.
In Fatal Fury 1, he was introduced as the legendary master of the style known as Hakkyokuseiken and as the man responsible for training several of the series' main characters, like Andy Bogard.
Throughout his appearances, Tung is always depicted as an elderly man in his late 60s to early 80s and I've always found that entertaining.
His small stature makes it so that you have to get in-close - Ryo2005 did a nice job of giving him a kit that enables him to do that.
Tung doesn't have a projectile but he typically has pretty quick movement, and once you're in you can inflict quite a bit of damage in fast flurries.
Let's take a look at the movelist that Ryo2005 gave him.

However, Ryo2005's King of Fighters and Rage of the Dragons-inspired gameplay has not received the same following and wide adoption that PotS' gameplay has.
Most likely this is due to the fact that while Ryo2005's gameplay style
