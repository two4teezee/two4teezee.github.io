# About

I joined the Mugen scene in 2004 and started creating almost right away. My first release was the Broken98 Lifebars, which were loosely inspired by the KOF98 lifebars. The release seemed successful, and I started spending more time looking into screenpacks. After roughly a year of work, I release brokenMUGEN 0.99 in 2007. 

Since then, my adventure with Mugen has continued. After several years off, I returned to the scene to find it much different than it had been when I left it. But something magical happened - many of the "old school" creators gathered around Ikemen GO. This community is now my home. I try to stay relatively active... maybe this website will keep me on top of things!
